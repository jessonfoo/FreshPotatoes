## JavaScript Style guide

**Semicolons**: Always use.

**Naming**: Use camel case everywhere but constants. Use all caps snake case for constants.

**Strings**: Use single quotes.

**Curly Braces**: Start your curly braces on the same line as whatever they're opening.

**Spacing**: Indent new lines two spaces. Put a space between arguments in a function. For parentheses/curly brackets, no spaces after opening bracket and before closing.
